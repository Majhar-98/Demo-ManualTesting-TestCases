## What is manual testing?
Manual software testing is when human testers check the quality of a new application without using automation tools or scripting. 
The purpose is to identify bugs or defects, ensure the product is error-free, and check it conforms to specified functional requirements.

## How manual testing is performed:
-- Understand requirements
-- Prepare test cases
-- Review test cases
-- Execute test cases
-- Report bugs
-- Test again
